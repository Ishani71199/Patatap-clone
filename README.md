# Patatap-clone
Patatap is a portable animation and sound kit. With the touch of a finger create melodies sound. While easy to pick up there is a wide range of possibilities. Switch between multiple color palettes and matching soundscapes on the fly. Play on your desktop keyboard. Patatap invites creators of all ages to engage the mind and senses in a different type of creation process. In the case of Patatap, sounds trigger colorful visual animations.

## Implementation:
- Kindly include ‘circle.html’ and ‘sounds’ files in the same directory then run the html code in visual studio, sublime text, or any other text editor.
- If the ‘sound’ folder is downloaded as a zip file then first unzip the file extract it then include in the same directory where ‘circle.html’ is present (remember to unzip the file).	
- Whenever a key is pressed between a-z (no tab, no spacebar, no number keys, etc.) it creates animated circles with changing circle size and each key having its own sound.
